# D3-Research-Visualization
## About:
This interactive visualization project started with static visualizations created on Circos under the guidance of School of Data Science faculty. Since then, it has evolved into a customized, interactive site that allows users to toggle between R1 institutes. The site can be accessed at: https://annayao0602.github.io/D3-Research-Visualization.

## To use:
The circos.js file has been created to be reusable. Replace necessary variables (ex. d.uniqueId) with new column names and run using the functions found in main.js. Adjust as needed.
