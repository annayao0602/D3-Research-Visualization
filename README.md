# D3-Research-Visualization

This interactive visualization project started with static visualizations created on Circos under the guidance of School of Data Science faculty. Since then, it has evolved into a customized, interactive site that allows users to toggle between R1 institutes. The site can be accessed at: https://annayao0602.github.io/D3-Research-Visualization.
